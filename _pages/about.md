I have a confession: I love making PowerPoint presentations. When I started
graduate school, I dreaded assembling figures and writing slides. My attitude
changed as I prepared for a talk during my second year and realized that I was
simply telling a story. I embraced the challenge of transforming microscopy
images into narratives that guided the audience toward my conclusions.

My graduate work revolved around analyzing those images; that experience
inspired me to become a data engineer. Though I enjoyed the technical details
of the work, I missed the fulfillment of crafting stories. As an aspiring
science journalist, I hope to use data to explain scientific news and
concepts through a variety of mediaâ€”maybe even a PowerPoint or two.
