Hello! I'm Jack, a [science reporter](https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/jack-lee/) with the San Francisco Chronicle.

My path to science journalism has taken a few twists and turns. I earned a Ph.D. in [molecular biology](https://molbio.princeton.edu/) at Princeton Unversity and worked as a data engineer before completing the [science communication program](https://scicom.ucsc.edu/) at UC Santa Cruz.

Now, I'm excited to have the opportunity to share my excitement for science and data!
